<h3 id="proteins">Proteins</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Found in meat, nuts, and eggs- sources of amino acids.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="fats">Fats</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Major source of stored energy in the body
    <ul>
      <li>Saturated fats</li>
      <li>Unsaturated fats
        <ul>
          <li>Mono-unsaturated fats- oleic acid in olive oil</li>
          <li>Poly-unsaturated fats- salmon and corn oil</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="carbohydrates">Carbohydrates</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Simple carbohydrates- simple sugars- monosaccharides (fructose, glucose) 
and dissachrides (lactose, sucrose) found in fruit juices, honey, candy or sodas.
    <ul>
      <li>This type of carbohydrate provides ready energy because your body has to do
very little work to convert simple sugars to glucose.  They are digested
quickly and easily, sending a rush of glucose into your blood stream. 
When your body is flooded with glucose in this way, you experience a 
temporary sugar high caused by the spike in your blood sugar level.  A 
short time later, as the glucose leaves your system, you experience a crash,
which leaves you feeling fatigued and listless- and hungry again as your 
body craves more fuel.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Complex carbohydrates- whole grains- brown rice, wheat, oats, barley, quinoa
  and corn, legumes (beans), and vegetables are made up of much more complicated
  sugar molecules.
    <ul>
      <li>Your body needs to work much harder to break these 
complex sugars down and convert them to glucose.  Because of the extra 
effort required to digest these foods, digestion takes place over an 
extended period of time- and the glucose your body gets from these foods is
released into your blood stream at a slower, steadier pace.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Examples of good carbohydrates
    <ul>
      <li>Vegetables- all of them</li>
      <li>Whole fruits- apples, bananas, strawberries</li>
      <li>Whole grains- pure oats, quinoa, brown rice</li>
      <li>Legumes- lentils, kidney beans, peas</li>
      <li>Nuts- almondds, walnuts, hazel nuts, peanuts, macadamia nuts</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Exceptions to simple carb rule are- milk products and fruits.  Because
 milk products and fruits are relatively low in sugar and provide big doses
 of imortant vitamins and minerals- fruits also provide fiber- these foods
 can be enjoyed as a regular part of a healthful diet.  Choose fresh fruits
 instead of fruit juices and low fat or non-fat milk products.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="recommendations-from-dr-valter-longo">Recommendations from Dr Valter Longo</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Plenty of vegetables and legumes and a generous splash of olive oil</li>
  <li>Key to longevity is to slow down the growth hormone receptor (GHR).
    <ul>
      <li>Proteins activate the GHR- which increases the level of insulin- which is
linked to diabetes and cancer.</li>
      <li>Proteins activate TOR-S6K- genes that accelerate aging.</li>
      <li>Sugars activate PKA- another gene that accelerate aging.</li>
      <li>Reducing calories, particularly from proteins and sugars- decrease the
activites of the GHR- and indirectly- TOR-S6K and PKA.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Keep diet to 80% plant and 20% fish.  Keep fish to wild salmon.  Tuna has 
high levels of mercury- canned light tuna has less- but better stick to 
salmon, sardines and cod.</li>
  <li>Eat just enough proteins- about 50 grams of protein a day.  Get an 
<a href="https://www.livestrong.com/article/501118-50-gram-protein-diet/">estimate of protein levels here.</a></li>
  <li>Eat good unsaturated fats</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="difference-between-white-rice-and-brown-rice">Difference between white rice and brown rice</h2>

<p>White rice is what you get when you remove the husk, 
bran and germ from whole grain – or brown rice. 
When you lose the bran – you lose the fiber. 
When you lose the germ – you lose B vitamins and some fat. 
All that remains is the endosperm, making white rice essentially, 
nutritionally naked starch.</p>

<p>Consumers like white rice because it’s light and fluffy. 
Food manufacturers like it because without the fat it is less likely 
to go rancid and has a longer shelf life than whole grain rice does</p>

<h2 id="what-is-wrong-with-starch">What is wrong with starch?</h2>

<p><strong>Starches</strong> include grain products, such as bread, crackers, pasta, 
and rice. As with simple sugars, some complex carbohydrate foods are 
better choices than others. Refined grains, such as 
white flour and white rice, have been processed, which removes nutrients 
and fiber.</p>

<p><strong>White rice</strong> is considered empty carbs since it loses its main sources 
of nutrients. … A 3.5-ounce (100-gram) serving of <strong>brown rice</strong> has 
fewer calories and carbs than white rice and twice as much fiber. 
In general, brown rice also has higher amounts of vitamins and minerals 
than white rice.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-free-radicals-and-antioxidants">What are free radicals and antioxidants?</h2>

<p>Free radicals are unstable atoms that can damage cells, causing illness and 
aging.  <a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/information-about-free-radicals-2249103">Read here</a>

<p><strong>Dr Gott</strong> from <em>Dr. Gott’s No Flour, No Sugar Diet</em> says-</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>While many a low-carb diet guru would have you believe that all carbohyrates
are created equal- and are equally to blame for making you fat- they are just 
plain wrong.  Fresh fruits and vegetables- as well as whole grains- are full of
the essential vitamins, minerals, and fiber that we need to have healthy bodies, 
protect ourselves against disease, and function properly.  The problem arises 
when technology takes over the digestion process, removing all those valuable 
nutrients…</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Simply put, the more refined a carb is, the fewer nutrients it contains because
it has already been broken down, by the refining process, to its elemental form.
Modern processing technology has manged to take once healthful whole grains 
and strip them of their very benefits.  The whole grain, for instance, a veritable 
nutrition workhorse in its natural form, is steamed, pounded, and scraped to 
remove its outer fiber-full bran layer, its mineral-dense germ, and its vitamin-
rich oil.  Next it is pulverised by high speed steel rollers into a fine powder,
then bleached to remove any possible likeness to its original form.  This powdery
white substance is then labeled ‘all-purpose flour’ and used to make almost
all of the breads, cookies, crackers, cereals, and pastas you find on your 
supermarket shelves.  Even those toasty brown ‘wheat breads’ are often made with 
white flour and then artifically colored to make them look ‘healthy’.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>After all that processing, flour retains its high calorie nature but little
else.  It is virtually devoid of fiber and the vitamins and minerals our bodies
need to function properly and fend off disease.  The calories in all-purpose
flour are what nutritionists call ‘empty calories’.  They will fill you up and 
provide instance energy, but they won’t nourish your body for the long haul.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The point of my No Flour, No Sugar Diet is to replace the empty calories
of highly refined foots with the nutrient dense calories found in unprocessed
foots.  So when I say no flour- I mean no all-purpose flour, but also no whole
wheat flour or any product with the word flour in its ingredient list….
All carbs are allowed on the diet except for those foods that contain flour. 
This means that you can still enjoy rice, potatoes, barley, oats, peas, corn,
beans, vegetables and fruits.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dr Gott says</p>

<ol>
  <li>Avoid food containing
    <ul>
      <li>flour of any kind- wheat, rice, and corn flours- examples- pizza, pasta, buttery cookies</li>
      <li>refined or concentrated sugars- cane sugar, beet sugar, glocose, sucrose, 
  high frutose corn syrup, maple syrup, honey- examples- cakes, ice-cream</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Eat
    <ul>
      <li>whole grains and starchy vegetables- brown rice, potatoes, barley, oats, peas, 
  corn, beans, vegetables and fruits.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Maintain a body-mass index of 18.5-24.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Robert Davis, PhD</strong> in <em>Coffee is good for You</em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Fish oil prevents heart disease…the key ingredients appear to be the omega-3
fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which 
are found in most fish but especially oily ones such as salmon, mackerel, trout,
sardines, and tuna.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Eggs are not bad for your heart…Eating up to six a week doesn’t appear to be
harmful for most healthy people.  So how can this be if egg yolks are high in 
cholesterol and too much cholesterol is bad for us?  Most of our cholesterol is
made by the liver, which ramps up production when we eat saturated and trans
fats.  But cholesterol from food appears to have little impact on most people’s 
cholesterol levels.  Eggs are relatively low in saturated fat, and they contain
unsaturated fats, which may be beneficial.  Plus, they’re a good source of 
protein and several vitamins and minerals.  They can be a healthful and more 
filling alternative to high-calorie muffins, begals, and sugary cereals.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nuts prevent heart attacks…Nuts lower LDL (bad) cholesterol levels.  They
also appear to decrease inflammation in arteries, which may contribute to heart
attacks…So which nuts are best for you?… Walnuts, for example, are richest
in ALA, an omega-3 fatty acid and peanuts contain resveratrol, a substance
also found in red wine… All nuts are relatively high in unsaturated fats, 
which care thought to be good for the heart.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Trans fats (partially hydrogenated fats) are harmful…Like saturated fats, 
trans fats were found to raise LDL (bad) cholesterol, but they also lowered 
HDL (good) cholesterol.  People who consume the most trans fats are more likely
to develop heart disease.  The increased risk appears to come from artificially
created trans fats, not those that occur naturally in milk and meat.  Scientists
suspect that trans fats cause harm by not only affecting cholestrol levels but
also raising blood fats called triglycerides, promoting inflammation in arteries,
and adversely affecting the lining of blood vessels.  Overall, the evidence
suggests trans fats are more harmful than saturated fats, and it’s more 
consistent.  To avoid it, check ingredient labels and steer clear of anything
containing partially hydrogenated oils.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Gene Stone</strong> in <em>The Secrets of People Who Never Get Sick</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>According to Susan Roberts, professor at the Friedman School of Nutrition
Science and Policy at Tufts University and author of <em>The “I” Diet</em>, her study
of caloric reduction calls for a 25 percent cut in calories, but she believes it
can be done in any way the dieter wishes as long as it feels comfortable-
eating a full diet one day and then cutting calories the next, or eating a normal
meal once a day with a reduced meal at other times…</p>
