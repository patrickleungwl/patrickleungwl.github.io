Some others either push southern Africa rightinto the frame, which  represented the end of the world or, as in Ptolemy's maps, curve it sharply right and attached the lower tip of Africa to the Indian Peninsula. </p> <p>But there were also ancient stories about the possibility of rounding the southern tip of Africa from either direction.  For example, Eudoxus was a Greek explorer who at least twice in the second century BCE started from Greek-occupied Egypt and sailed down the Arabian Sea, out across the Gulf of Aden, and then using the Indian monsoon winds, sailed further into the Indian Ocean.

For centuries, Arab sailors ruled the Indian Ocean and for centuries they  had been peacefully trading in those waters, known to Arabs as the Sea of  Zani, going as far as the island of Mauritius and just east of Madagascar, both close to the African coast.

The rest is mechanics.  As I use the term, management is not a \ncollection of boxes with names and titles on the organizational chart. \nManagement is a living force.  It is the force that gets things done to \nacceptable standards- high standards.  You either have it in a company or \nyou don't.  Management must have a purpose, a dedication, and that dedication\nmust be an emotional commitment.  It must be built in a vital part of the\npersonality of anyone who is truly a manager.  He or she is the one who \nunderstands that management must mange. \n\nThe attitude is a self-fulfilling one, too.  The man who says, \"I must do \nthis,\" will stay at his task until all hours, trying again and again and \nagain, until he finds a satsifactory answer.  The answer must be, above all,\nsatisfactory to him.  And he will know it.  There may be seventy-eight ways\nto do something and only ten of them with satisfactorily good answers.  The\nmanager will continue to probe and to seek for one of those ten answers. \nIt may not be the best of all answers.  But he won't settle for anything lower\nthan one of those ten.  The next time he will strive for yet a better answer,\nhigher on the list, learning something new all the time, and achieving better\nresults as he goes along.  He will work this way because of his emotional \nattitude, more than anything else, and that attitude inevitably will be \nemulated by those who work with him, so that it becomes a way of life in that\norganization.  The urge to do what must be done is powered by deep-seated\nemotion, not logic.  He might not be able to explain why he works the way \nhe does, or why he makes this choice and not the other one.  He does it because\nhe 'feels' that it is right.  That feeling is transmitted to others who work\nfor him or with him.  They know his emotional commitment includes them as well\nas the goals of the enterprise.  They are willing to follow his lead because\nof that 'feeling' which makes him the kind of person he is.\n</code></pre> <pre><code>If the manager is to accomplish his objectives, he absolutely has to get the \ninformation necessary to make the right decisions.  The steps along the way\ndefine themselves as he goes toward his objectives.  To surmount each step,\nhe needs solid facts so that he can recognize the realities of situations. \nHis decisions, if based realistically upon reliable information, will not be \nall that difficult.  Facts are power.  They are crucial to good management.\nIn order to get the straight facts in any situation, the manager must ask \nstraight questions, and to do that he must do his homework so that he has a \ndeep understanding of what he is encountering.  If he has a good record of \nmaking the right decisions, he can help people around him to be effective\nand successful in their own areas, so that their total accomplishments is\ngreater than the sum of their individual parts.  That is leadership.\n\nAnd if the leadership is successful, it creates a momentum in the enterprise\nwhich enriches the participants with such a feeling of pride and energy\ntha they produce results, short-term and long-term results, which they \nthemselves never thought possible.  I've separated the elements here, but\nin practice, they all move along together, en masse, nourishing each other\nlike the fusion in a nuclear reactor, creating the fire, the pressure, and the\npower which produce energy.  All this is the critical emotional content\nof good management.\n\nThis is the emotional horsepower that drives people to do things, drives them\nto keep at it because they feel they must get the answer, drives them to push\non until they get results that are satisfactory to them.  Of course, you don't\nalways succeed in every effort.  But then you recognize it early on, and \nyou get out of that situation.  You cut your losses and go on to something\nelse.

Fresh fruits and vegetables- as well as whole grains- are full of the essential vitamins, minerals, and fiber that we need to have healthy bodies,  protect ourselves against disease, and function properly.  The problem arises  when technology takes over the digestion process, removing all those valuable  nutrients... </p> <p>Simply put, the more refined a carb is, the fewer nutrients it contains because it has already been broken down, by the refining process, to its elemental form. Modern processing technology has manged to take once healthful whole grains  and strip them of their very benefits.  The whole grain, for instance, a veritable  nutrition workhorse in its natural form, is steamed, pounded, and scraped to  remove its outer fiber-full bran layer, its mineral-dense germ, and its vitamin- rich oil.  Next it is pulverised by high speed steel rollers into a fine powder, then bleached to remove any possible likeness to its original form.  This powdery white substance is then labeled 'all-purpose flour' and used to make almost all of the breads, cookies, crackers, cereals, and pastas you find on your  supermarket shelves.  Even those toasty brown 'wheat breads' are often made with  white flour and then artifically colored to make them look 'healthy'. </p> <p>After all that processing, flour retains its high calorie nature but little else.  It is virtually devoid of fiber and the vitamins and minerals our bodies need to function properly and fend off disease.  The calories in all-purpose flour are what nutritionists call 'empty calories'.  They will fill you up and  provide instance energy, but they won't nourish your body for the long haul.</p> <p>The point of my No Flour, No Sugar Diet is to replace the empty calories of highly refined foots with the nutrient dense calories found in unprocessed foots.  So when I say no flour- I mean no all-purpose flour, but also no whole wheat flour or any product with the word flour in its ingredient list.... All carbs are allowed on the diet except for those foods that contain flour.  This means that you can still enjoy rice, potatoes, barley, oats, peas, corn, beans, vegetables and fruits.</p> <p>Avoid food containing </p> <ul> <li>flour of any kind- wheat, rice, and corn flours- examples- pizza, pasta, buttery cookies</li> <li>refined or concentrated sugars- cane sugar, beet sugar, glocose, sucrose,       high frutose corn syrup, maple syrup, honey- examples- cakes, ice-cream</li> </ul> <p>Eat</p> <ul> <li>whole grains and starchy vegetables- brown rice, potatoes, barley, oats, peas,    corn, beans, vegetables and fruits.</li> </ul> <p>Maintain a body-mass index of 18.5-24.  </p> <p>BMI = 703 * Weight in pounds / Height in inches squared  .</p> <p>Robert Davis, PhD in Coffee is good for You</p> <p>Fish oil prevents heart disease...the key ingredients appear to be the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which  are found in most fish but especially oily ones such as salmon, mackerel, trout, sardines, and tuna.  </p> <p>Eggs are not bad for your heart...Eating up to six a week doesn't appear to be harmful for most healthy people.  So how can this be if egg yolks are high in  cholesterol and too much cholesterol is bad for us?  Most of our cholesterol is made by the liver, which ramps up production when we eat saturated and trans fats.  But cholesterol from food appears to have little impact on most people's  cholesterol levels.  Eggs are relatively low in saturated fat, and they contain unsaturated fats, which may be beneficial.  Plus, they're a good source of  protein and several vitamins and minerals.  They can be a healthful and more  filling alternative to high-calorie muffins, begals, and sugary cereals. </p> <p>Nuts prevent heart attacks...Nuts lower LDL (bad) cholesterol levels.  They also appear to decrease inflammation in arteries, which may contribute to heart attacks...So which nuts are best for you?... Walnuts, for example, are richest in ALA, an omega-3 fatty acid and peanuts contain resveratrol, a substance also found in red wine... All nuts are relatively high in unsaturated fats,  which care thought to be good for the heart.</p> <p>Trans fats (partially hydrogenated fats) are harmful...Like saturated fats,  trans fats were found to raise LDL (bad) cholesterol, but they also lowered  HDL (good) cholesterol.  People who consume the most trans fats are more likely to develop heart disease.  The increased risk appears to come from artificially created trans fats, not those that occur naturally in milk and meat.  Scientists suspect that trans fats cause harm by not only affecting cholestrol levels but also raising blood fats called triglycerides, promoting inflammation in arteries, and adversely affecting the lining of blood vessels.  Overall, the evidence suggests trans fats are more harmful than saturated fats, and it's more  consistent.  To avoid it, check ingredient labels and steer clear of anything containing partially hydrogenated oils. </p> <p>Gene Stone in The Secrets of People Who Never Get Sick</p> <p>According to Susan Roberts, professor at the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University and author of The \"I\" Diet, her study of caloric reduction calls for a 25 percent cut in calories, but she believes it can be done in any way the dieter wishes as long as it feels comfortable- eating a full diet one day and then cutting calories the next, or eating a normal meal once a day with a reduced meal at other times...</p>"},{"location":"archives/2019/2019-07-20-all-about-dieting/#food-groups-macro-nutrients","title":"Food groups- Macro nutrients","text":""},{"location":"archives/2019/2019-07-20-all-about-dieting/#proteins","title":"Proteins","text":"<ul> <li>Found in meat, nuts, and eggs- sources of amino acids.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"archives/2019/2019-07-20-all-about-dieting/#fats","title":"Fats","text":"<ul> <li>Major source of stored energy in the body</li> <li>Saturated fats</li> <li>Unsaturated fats<ul> <li>Mono-unsaturated fats- oleic acid in olive oil </li> <li>Poly-unsaturated fats- salmon and corn oil</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"archives/2019/2019-07-20-all-about-dieting/#carbohydrates","title":"Carbohydrates","text":"<ul> <li>Simple carbohydrates- simple sugars- monosaccharides (fructose, glucose)    and dissachrides (lactose, sucrose) found in fruit juices, honey, candy or sodas.</li> <li>This type of carbohydrate provides ready energy because your body has to do   very little work to convert simple sugars to glucose.

But pragmatic value investors feel just the  opposite.  They believe high return and low risk can be achieved simulatenously by buying things for less than they're worth.  In the same way, overpaying implies both low return and high risk.\"</p> <p>Let's aim for buying something with good value at a low price.</p> <p>\"Riskier investments are those for which the outcome is less certain.  That is, the probabily distribution of returns is wider.  When priced fairly, riskier investments should entail: - higher expected returns - the possibility of lower returns, and - in some cases, the possibility of losses\"</p> <p>The traditional graph where higher risk means higher returns is not totally  correct.  A high return for higher risk is only one possible outcome for a  range of possible outcomes.  Other possible outcomes are higher losses.  A higher risk asset has a wider range of possible outcomes.</p> <p>\"The most common bell-shaped distrbiution is called the 'normal' distribution. However, people often use the terms bell-shaped and normal interchangeably and they're not the same.  The former is a general type of distribution,  while the latter is a specific bell-shaped distribution with very definite statistical properties.\"</p> <p>\"In the years leading up to the crisis, financial engineers, or 'quants'  played a big part in creating and evaluating financial products such as  deriatives and structured entitites.  In many cases they made the assumption that future events would be normally distributed.  But the normal distribution assumed events in the distant tails will happen extremely infrequently, while the distribution of financial developments- shaped by humans, with their  tendancy to go to emotion-driven extremes of behavior- should probably be  seen as having 'fatter' tails.  Thus, when widespread mortgage defaults began to occur, events thought to be unlikely befell mortgage-related vehicles on a regular basis.  Investors in vehicles that had been constructed on the basis of normal-distributions, without much allowance for 'tail events' (black swans)  often saw the wheels come off. </p> <p>Investors run for the exits at the same time, and that's when extremes  happen.  This almost relates to the motion of fluids or people in crowded  streets.  When both achieve a critical mass, disasters happen.</p> <p>\"There's a big difference between probability and outcome.  Probable things fail to happen- and improbable things happen- all the time.\"</p> <p>\"Most people view risk taking primarily as a way to make money.  Bearing higher risk generally produces higher returns.  The market has set things up to look  like that'll be the case; if it didn't, people wouldn't make risky investments. But it can't always work that way, or else risky investments wouldn't be risky.

At the extreme of the pendulums's upswing, the belief that risk is low and that the investment in question is sure to  produce profits intoxicates the herd and cuases its members to forget caution, worry and fear of loss, and instead to obsess about the risk of missing opportunity.\" </p> <p>This comment is true for every bubble and subsequent crash. </p> <p>\"The recent crisis came about primarily because investors partook of novel,  complex and dangerous things, in greater amounts than ever before.

In short, they believed they were living in a low-risk world.\"</p> <p>\"When everyone believes something embodies no risk, they usually bid it up to  the point where it's enormously risky.

(An aside: a new colleague, on hearing my praises of dark themes for  working at night, remarked incredulously, 'You work at night?'.  I was too shocked to reply.

In addition, there is a chicken-and-egg problem.  There is no  way to get the driver files for either your wifi card or usb without internet  connectivity.  But for machines stationed far away from the router, this is  quite a problem. </p> <p>After hefting the machine next to the router, some online forum postings advised to download and install the correct wifi driver for my adapter.  To find the  proper driver required, use the lsusb command.  And then use the EndeavourOS package manager tool yay to download and install that driver. </p> <p>A quick look with lsusb shows:</p> <pre><code>lsusb\n\nBus 001 Device 003: ID 0bda:8813 Realtek Semiconductor Corp. RTL8814AU 802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wireless Adapter\n</code></pre> <p>This identified the usb adapter chipset as RTL8814AU.

And at the same time, I am a new adopter of Alexei Lebedev's OpenACR .  My idea at the beginning of 2024 was \"why not try out both at the same time?\" It would be a challenging experience to document the learning effort on using OpenACR on a  new OS.</p> <p>First of all, what is EndeavourOS?  EndeavourOS  is a minimal Linux distribution which has been a delight to use over the past year. On my home desktop, a relatively weak Lenovo ThinkCentre M92p, this OS has been  stable and performant.  Moreover, its dark space-based themes look simply cool and modern.</p> <p></p> <p>And second, what is OpenACR?  OpenACR is a software framework for building software. In other words, it is meta-software, a tool that builds other tools.  It relies  on a common data dictionary to store a program's data structures and generates the necessary code for managing their memory allocations, deallocations, lookups, and updates.  In brief, OpenACR is a code generator which generates code from  application metadata.</p>"},{"location":"linux/openacr/#openacr-style","title":"OpenACR style","text":"<p>While the use of code generation is not new, there are pros and cons with  OpenACR's approach.  The pros with code generation is that 1) common bugs with  handling memory are mostly avoided, 2) the code is extremely type-safe, and 3) most everyone can read each other's code.  One con with  OpenACR is the effort it takes for a C++ developer to get used to reading  ACR's generated code.  A C++ developer usually expects to see a class wrapped  around 1) some data and 2) functions that handle that data.  With generated  OpenACR code, this idea is instead reversed. </p> <p>A picture is worth a thousand words- so here is a concrete example.  Let's say we have two data structures each with its own sort operation. In C++, we'd see something like this:</p> <pre><code>class A {\n  int a[10];\npublic:\n  void sort();\n};\n\nclass B {\n  double b[10];\npublic:\n  void sort();\n};\n</code></pre> <p>With OpenACR, the generated code would look something like this:</p> <pre><code>struct A {\n    int a[10];\n};\n\nstruct B {\n    double b[10];\n};\n\nvoid A_sort(A &amp;a);\nvoid B_sort(B &amp;b);\n</code></pre> <p>To use OpenACR, a developer avoids thinking about classes and member functions and  rather, thinks about generated functions that operates on data structures.  It's  reversed.  This may take some time to digest and wrap your head around.

The command ai runs the  script bin/select-bootstrap to consider the specific build file for the system's  architecture and compiler.  The problem with this script is that it only considers the compilers clang++ and g++.  It does not detect the compiler's version so it never considers running the bootstrap script for gc++ version 9 or higher.
