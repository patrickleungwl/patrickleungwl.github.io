                With Java 1.5, if you want a function to execute at a certain time in the future, it is no longer necessary to create timers and callbacks. Java 1.5 has a ExecutorService that can execute tasks at scheduled times.

                Overheard Microsoft taunting Oracle the other day- “Anything you can do, I can do better.”  8-) When it comes to memory management, C# certainly has many comparable features found in Java and more. Following the previous example of testing WeakReferences in Java, we’ll now run a similar test in C#. First, we’ll need a dummy memory resource-heavy object. We’ll use the same DumbWeight class, whose sole function is to allocate memory. using System.Collection.Generic; namespace Drills...
