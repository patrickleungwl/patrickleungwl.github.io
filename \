Here is the crucial idea from the book 'The Spirit of Kaizen' by Robert Maurer.

The ** *key idea* ** is that people are scared by big changes.  Instead of
making big changes to fix big problems, ** *make small changes* ** instead.  

First, small changes are quick and easy to implement and should encounter
less resistance by stake-holders.  

Second, the effect of small changes over time is similar to that of compound
interest.  Small changes accumulate giant effects over time.

When making a change- there are two basic strategies- 1) innovation and 2) kaizen.

***Innovation*** calls for a radical, immediate rethink of the status quo.  

***Kaizen***, on the other hand, asks for nothing other than small, doable steps toward
improvement.

Continuous improvement says- Look for hundreds of small things you can
improve.  Look for improvements on existing jobs with your present equipment.

Kaizen advises-

* Use exiting resources
* Ask team members to participate
* Remain alert for problems to solve
* Look for ways to improve customer service
* Make very very small steps toward change

Jim Collin's Good To Great says- 

> We kept thinking we should find the 'one big thing,' the miracle moment that
> defined breakthrough....
>
> But...no matter how dramatic the end result, the good-to-great transformation 
> never happened in one fell swoop.  There was no single defining action, no 
> grand program, no one killer innovation, no solitary lucky break, no wrenching 
> revolution.  Good to great comes about by a cumulative process- step by step, 
> action by action, decision by decision, turn by turn of the flywheel- that adds 
> up to sustains and spectacular results.*

> High-reliability organisations know they cannot afford to play games of
> secrecy.  Their attention to small mistakes flows from the recognition that
> human beings, no matter how gifted, are fallible.  Instead of expecting staff
> members to be perfect, HROs require them to be transparent... *If you make a
> mistake, tell us so that we can prevent a bigger problem.*  FIX THE PROBLEM,
> NOT THE BLAME.
