Waiting


  It’s waiting that helps you as an investor, and a lot of people 
just can’t stand to wait.


When to Bet Heavily


  You should remember that good ideas are rare- when the odds are
greatly in your favor, bet heavily.


The Herd


  Mimicking the herd invites regression to the mean.

                Working in the shadow of traders, I overhear some of their money making strategies. So yesterday at the Washington Zoo, I spotted a perfect money making opportunity reminiscent of traders’ strategies. There was a souvenir penny-engraving machine that presses souvenir pennies for 50 cents plus the one penny. Next to it was a machine that makes change for one and five dollar bills.
