                Nassim Tabeb’s “Fooled By Randomness” is such a great book, I thought I’d save some great passages here. On attributing brilliance to success: A few years ago, when I told one A, a then Master-of-the-Universe type, that track records were less relevant than he thought, he found the remark so offensive that he violently flung his cigarette lighter in my direction. The episode taught me a lot. Remember that nobody accepts randomness in his own...

Waiting


  It’s waiting that helps you as an investor, and a lot of people 
just can’t stand to wait.


When to Bet Heavily


  You should remember that good ideas are rare- when the odds are
greatly in your favor, bet heavily.


The Herd


  Mimicking the herd invites regression to the mean.

There was a souvenir penny-engraving machine that presses souvenir pennies for 50 cents plus the one penny. Next to it was a machine that makes change for one and five dollar bills.
