            <h2 id="for-the-public-record">For the Public Record</h2>

<p>A quick look at the calendar shows it’s that time of the year again.  The date
creeps up on you.  This year, however- marks the fifteenth year since that
horrible day- a day that’s been seared into my memory.  Fifteen years is a great
number of years that’s passed.  Volumes have already been written to record, 
to analyse, and to reflect on what happened that day.  It seems a proper civic
duty to add my own recollections of that day from my point of view to the public
record.  For this reason- I record the following entry.</p>

<h2 id="like-any-other-day">Like Any Other Day</h2>

<p>September 11, 2001- was just like any other early autumn day.  I was a young
Goldman Sachs programmer heading into work that morning in Lower Manhattan.  I had
recently transferred to the electronic trading team and was looking forward to a 
day of testing GS’s system with Cantor Fitzgerald’s eSpeed.</p>

<p>I was slightly peeved when the N train I took to work from Brooklyn stopped 
without explanation at Pacific Street.  Thinking that it was a usual MTA 
malfunction, I walked over to the nearby Atlatnic Street station to transfer to 
the uptown 4 train.  This train took me to the Battery Park Bowling Green
station- which was only 2 blocks away the offices at 125 Broad Street.</p>

<p>The time was 9:15AM.  I remember the exact time because at that point I was 
slightly peeved at being made tardy for work by the failing public transit
system.  As I rushed up the station exit 
staircase to make up for lost time, a work colleague grabbed me on the shoulder.  He 
was heading in the opposite direction on the way down the station staircase.  In 
terse words, he told me to go home.  Puzzled, I asked why.  He said- “Look up.
Two planes crashed into the World Trade Center.” and quickly disappeared down the stairs.</p>

<h2 id="look-up">“Look Up”</h2>

<p>Right at the top of the station exit stairs, I arced my head up and looked straight
up Broadway.  Against a cloudless blue sky, I saw huge rising plumes of smoke. 
Fortunately, I was a tech enthusiast- and happened to be carrying a digital camera 
at the time.  Remember- this was back in 2001- in the era before iPhones and 
before iPods.  I took this snapshot-</p>

<p><img src="../../../../../assets/images/200109/20010911_looking_up_broadway.jpg" /></p>

<p>Though my colleague had told me what happened, it just didn’t register that what
he said was real.  If the relevation were real, I could only surmise it was 
terrorism.  That thought just did not register in me.  In 2001, terrorism was the sort of
news event that only happened in the Middle East or Africa.  Even though there was 
a WTC bombing in 1994, it was already a forgotten memory.</p>

<h2 id="just-get-to-work">“Just Get To Work”</h2>

<p>The thought of leaving did not occur to me.  My objective- quite stupefying now
looking back- but oddly rational at the time- was <em>to get to work</em>.  It must be 
the years of social conditioning that makes someone show up to work even as 
the world burns.</p>

<p>I walked two blocks eastward to Goldman Sach’s office building at 85 Broad Sreet- 
and found a throng of people gathered at the entrance.  It seemed that just about 
everyone had come down from the building.  Unbeknownst to me at the time- but I 
learned a few days afterwards- my GS colleagues had just witnessed the second 
plane crash into the towers and were making their way out of the building
as I was trying to make my way in.  I guessed that my absence from the office 
could be excused that day.</p>

<p>At around 9:20AM, I took this snapshot of 85 Broad Street.</p>

<p><img src="../../../../../assets/images/200109/20010911_85_broad.jpg" /></p>

<p>As can be seen, there was no panic at the time- just a general confusion as 
to what was going on.</p>

<p>Since there was no way then to get to work- I had no other destination than to
walk up Broadway- <em>towards</em> the source of the smoke.  Having a digital camera 
available at the time presented an opportunity that further egged me into taking 
a closer look at the smoke.   As I made my way past Wall Street along Broadway, 
the skyscrapers blocked my view of the towers and I could not imagine what was on fire.</p>

<p>At around 9:25AM, I took a third snapshot of the smoke above lower Manattan 
office buildings.</p>

<p><img src="../../../../../assets/images/200109/20010911_smoke_over_lower_manhattan.jpg" /></p>

<h2 id="surreal">Surreal</h2>

<p>The scene was surreal.  With smoke in the skies, I saw what looked like pieces 
of paper floating down from the sky.  As I walked further up Broadway, I finally reached 
Liberty Plaza.  This plaza, with a clearing void of any buildings- finally 
allowed me to get a good view of the towers.</p>

<p>What I saw dumbstruck me for a second.  I saw a whole section of one tower was on 
fire.  I raised my camera for this shot.</p>

<p><img src="../../../../../assets/images/200109/20010911_tower_burning.jpg" /></p>

<p>I took another shot with the camera’s digitial zoom turned on.</p>

<p><img src="../../../../../assets/images/200109/20010911_tower_burning_zoom.jpg" /></p>

<p>I wasn’t sure what I felt.  It was a sense of disbelief.  Was this all 
real?  The amount of black smoke coming out of the building was sobering.  I did
not feel horror- because the strange thing is that I could not imagine what horror 
it was to be inside the floors where the fires were burning.  Adding to the 
surreality of the moment- were loose leaflets floating down weightlessly
from the sky.  They seem to float for an eternity as they fluttered earthbound.</p>

<p>Then as I ambled around to get a better angle of the view, I saw the second 
tower appear from behind the first- spewing the same maddening amount of black
noxious smoke as the first.</p>

<p>Finally ran into resistance-</p>
