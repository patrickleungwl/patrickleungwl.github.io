                Earlier I asked if generic collections were faster than non-generic collections? I cooked up a quick test to confirm my suspicions that non-generics were slower because of the work it needs to box primitives and then add the reference to the collection- whereas for generic collections, it just needed to add the primitive to its own memory allocation. But then a colleague asked- how about performance for collections of objects? Wouldn’t a generic collection do...

                Working in the shadow of traders, I overhear some of their money making strategies. So yesterday at the Washington Zoo, I spotted a perfect money making opportunity reminiscent of traders’ strategies. There was a souvenir penny-engraving machine that presses souvenir pennies for 50 cents plus the one penny. Next to it was a machine that makes change for one and five dollar bills.

So yesterday at the Washington Zoo, I spotted a perfect money making opportunity 
reminiscent of traders’ strategies.  There was a souvenir penny-engraving machine 
that presses souvenir pennies for 50 cents plus the one penny.  Next to it was a 
machine that makes change for one and five dollar bills.   Given a dollar bill, 
the machine returns 4 quarters and 2 pennies.  Given a 5 dollar bill, the machine 
returns 20 quarters and 10 pennies.</p>

                For the Public Record A quick look at the calendar shows it’s that time of the year again. The date creeps up on you. This year, however- marks the fifteenth year since that horrible day- a day that’s been seared into my memory. Fifteen years is a great number of years that’s passed. Volumes have already been written to record, to analyse, and to reflect on what happened that day. It seems a proper civic...
