                For the Public Record A quick look at the calendar shows it’s that time of the year again. The date creeps up on you. This year, however- marks the fifteenth year since that horrible day- a day that’s been seared into my memory. Fifteen years is a great number of years that’s passed. Volumes have already been written to record, to analyse, and to reflect on what happened that day. It seems a proper civic...

                Second challenge question from my kid. Again it took me some time to work out the problem. Singapore math questions are rather more like puzzles than math questions. What practical value do figuring out who has how many pencils serve in real life? To solve these questions, one needs some basic intelligence and an ample supply of heart- also known as perservence- or grit. Without grit, a weak-minded individual would just give up. And that’s...
