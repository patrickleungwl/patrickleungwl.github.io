                For the Public Record A quick look at the calendar shows it’s that time of the year again. The date creeps up on you. This year, however- marks the fifteenth year since that horrible day- a day that’s been seared into my memory. Fifteen years is a great number of years that’s passed. Volumes have already been written to record, to analyse, and to reflect on what happened that day. It seems a proper civic...

                Second challenge question from my kid. Again it took me some time to work out the problem. Singapore math questions are rather more like puzzles than math questions. What practical value do figuring out who has how many pencils serve in real life? To solve these questions, one needs some basic intelligence and an ample supply of heart- also known as perservence- or grit. Without grit, a weak-minded individual would just give up. And that’s...

                As my kid has been progressing through the Singapore school system, I’ve never been seriously challenged by primary school math until now. I was embarrassingly stomped by the following question. It took me some time to figure it out. I’ve posted the question and answer for everyone’s benefit. Mr Lee had some red and white paint. 1/3 of the paint was red. He used 1/2 of the red paint and 5/6 of the white paint....

                <p>“It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man
stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better.
The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the area,
whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood;
who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again,
because there is no effort without error and shortcoming;
but who does actually strive to do the deeds;
who knows great enthusiams, the great devotions;
who spends himself in a worthy cause;
who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement,
and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly,
so that his place shall never be with those cold and
timid souls who neither know victory or defeat.”
