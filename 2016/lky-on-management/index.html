If we succeed, others will later follow our path but first, we must work out that path and be succeessful. We should not brag about our strategies, especially before they have worked… we must quietly sort our options to test out and implement them. Some will fail, but the key ones must succeed if we are to stay ahead and be a beacon for progress.”</p> <h2 id="on-talent">On Talent</h2> <p>“I have learned that one high-calibre mind in charge of a Ministry makes the difference between success and failure of a major project. A top mind, given a task, brings together a group of other able men, organises them into a cohesive team, and away the project goes…”</p> <p>“Whenever I had lesser men in charge, the average or slightly above-average, I have had to keep pushing and probing them, to review problems, to identify roadblocks, to suggest solutions, to come back and to discover that less than the best has been achieved. To be exasperated and, often to be totally frustrated, is the price for not having an able and talented man in charge.”</p> <p>“(English financier) Gresham pointed that bad money drives out good money from circulation. Well, bad leaders drive out good men from high positions.”</p> <p>“Ability can be assessed fairly accurately by a person’s academic record and achievements at work. Character is not so easily measured. After some successes but too many failures, I concluded that it was more important, though more difficult, to assess a person’s character.”</p> <h2 id="on-plateaus">On Plateaus</h2> <p>“What I fear is complacency. When things always become better, people tend to want more for less work.”</p> <h2 id="deliver-what-you-promise">Deliver What You Promise</h2> <p>“What you say, you must mean, and what you mean, you must deliver. I always understate what I intend to do and overachieve.”</p> <h2 id="make-sure-every-button-works">Make Sure Every Button Works</h2> <p>“I want to make sure that every button works and even if you are using it only once in a while, please make sure every morning that it works. And if it doesn’t when I happen to be around, then somebody is going to be in for a tough time because I do not want sloppiness.”</p> <h2 id="free-of-ideology">Free of Ideology</h2> <p>“If there was one formula for our success, it was that we were constantly studying how to make things work, or how to make them work better. I was never a prisoner of any theory. What guided me were reason and reality. The acid test I applied to every theory or scheme was, would it work? This was the golden thread that ran through my years in office.”</p> </div> </article> <footer class="site-footer"> <div class="container"> <small class="block">&copy; 2019 Patrick Leung &middot; &lt;/&gt; Powered by <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and <a href="https://github.com/heiswayi/thinkspace">Thinkspace theme</a></small> </div> </footer> </main> <script type="text/javascript"> var _gaq = _gaq || []; _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-XXXXX-XX']); _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']); (function() { var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true; ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?
