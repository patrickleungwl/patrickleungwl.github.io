Java as a language has been in the public eye for close to two decades now.  And there shouldn't
really be anything new to an old techie, should there?  Well, surprise to say- there are some 
features that I rarely use.  One of these features is the "WeakReference".

What are WeakReferences used for? WeakReferences are used for keeping objects in memory for only 
as long as a variable references it. As soon as this strong reference disappears, this object held 
by the WeakReference is up for garbage collection. This makes WeakReferences quite handy for 
keeping high storage-cost objects in memory for only as long as you really need it.

Example, let's make a dummy class that does nothing but make heavy memory allocations:

~~~java
package drills; 

import java.util.ArrayList;

public class DumbWeight {
  private ArrayList<Integer> _weights;
  
  public DumbWeight(int weight) {
    _weights = new ArrayList<Integer>(weight);
    for (int i=0; i<weight; i++) {
      _weights.add(new Integer(i));
    }
  }
}

~~~

And here is the test code. The test code creates a thousand "DumbWeight" objects- each allocating one
hundred thousand Integers. While the WeakReferences keep track of the DumbWeights, we remove any strong
references to them. This leaves the WeakReference as the only link to the DumbWeights. The Garbage
Collector eventually spots this- and wipes out the DumbWeights over time. The CheckReferences method
periodically scans the set of WeakReferences to see if the DumbWeights still exist.

~~~java
package drills;
import java.lang.ref.*;
import java.util.*;

public class MyTest { 

  /** checkWeakReferences
   *  
   *  Check how many weak references still exist and not collected
   */
  private void checkWeakReferences(Set<WeakReference> s) {
    int numCollected = 0;
    Iterator<WeakReference> i = s.iterator();
    while (i.hasNext()) {
      WeakReference w = i.next();
      DumbWeight d = w.get();
      if (d==null) {
        ++numCollected;
      } 
    }
    System.out.format("checkWeakRefs: size=%d, numCollected=%dn",
      s.size(), numCollected );
  } 

  /** testWeakReferences
   *  
   *  If the GC collects weak references, then we should be
   *  able to create objects using WR indefinitely.
   *

  public void testWeakReferences() {

    Set<WeakReference> s = new HashSet<WeakReference>();

    System.out.println("*****************************"); 
    System.out.println("Starting testWeakReferences"); 
    System.out.println("Creating 1000 weak references");
    for (int i=0; i&lt;1000; i++) {
      DumbWeight d = new DumbWeight(100000);
      WeakReference w = new WeakReference(d);
      s.add(w);
      d = null;
      if (s.size()%100==0) {
        checkWeakReferences(s);
      } 
    }
    System.out.println("Completed testWeakReferences"); 
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) { 
    MyTest m = new MyTest();
    m.testWeakReferences();
  }
}

The output of one such test run is shown below. The memory usage of this Test app stays in the 220 meg range on a Linux laptop with 2Gb RAM.

*****************************

checkWeakRefs: size=900, numCollected=837
checkWeakRefs: size=1000, numCollected=924

As shown, because the objects, the DumbWeight instances, are only "weakly referenced" and not strongly referenced, the GC always collects them whenever it runs.

Hope the test code makes clear this feature of WeakReference.
