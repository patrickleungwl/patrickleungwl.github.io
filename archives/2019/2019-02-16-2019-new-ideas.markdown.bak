## Some Ideas To Resolve Soon
* Poisson distribution

* What is irvega rho?
* Some notes on financial markets
* How to use TensorFlow?
* How to use pivottable.js?
* How to use metplotlib for charts?
* Backtest strategy to buy on n% dips?
* Build pages on individual tickers
* How to host python script on AWS?
* Why use NumPy?


## New Investment Ideas
A new proposed idea is to buy on n% dips. Would this work? Or 
buy an index instead of individual stocks on such dips.

## PCA
[PCA - principal component analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis)
sounds very much like fourier 
transform. It is a statistical proceudre that reduces 100 variables 
to a few important- orthogonal (meaning unrelated) variables- 
principal components- that explains 95% of the movements of the 
original wave.

PCA is used primarily for making predictive models.

## Rho
[Rho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks_(finance)#Rho)
is the sensitivity of the option value to changes in the risk free 
interest rate.

## PivotTable.js
[PivotTable.js](https://pivottable.js.org/examples/rcsvs.html)
looks pretty powerful.

## Why use NumPy?
* ndarray- a fast and space efficient multi-dimensional array 
providing vectorized arithmetic operations and broadcasting capabilities
* functions for reading and writing to disk
* tools for integrating with C, C++ and Fortran
* math operations with no loops
* linear algebra and fourier transform functions

But what functions does NumPy provide and what from Pandas? I believe 
data analysis primarily use math functions from Pandas and use NumPy 
primarily for its fast ndarray.

Pandas runs on top of NumPy- so Pandas depends on NumPy. Pandas 
provides datatable-like functions- as well as stats, groupbys, merge 
and join methods.

Pandas was built starting in 2008 by Wes McKinney at AQR.

## Matplotlib for Quick Charts

## Poisson Distribution
Poisson Distribution is for modelling the number of times an event 
occurs in an interval of time or space- for example- the number of 
patients arriving in an emergency room between 10 and 11pm.

The following assumptions must be true in order to use Poisson 
Distribution

* k is the number of times an event occurs in an interval- like 0, 1, 2 â€¦
* The events are independent.
* The rate at which events occur is constant.
* Two events cannot occur at exactly the same time.
