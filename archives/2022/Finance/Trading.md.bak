## options

### market making

MM buys and sell options and earns the bid-ask spread.  

Suppose MM sells a 1 call option contract, making him delta negative.  He needs
to hedge the negative delta by buying the underlying equity.  If the delta is 
0.05, then on 1 option contract, he'd need to buy 5 shares of the underlying 
equity.  With 1 short call and 5 shares, the MM becomes delta neutral.

If the price of the underlying goes up, the call option delta also goes up. 
This means the MM is again not hedged.  For example, if the delta goes to 0.10,
the MM would need to hold 10 shares.  Since he already holds 5 shares, he'd go 
buy another 5 shares for a total of 10 shares- making him delta neutral.

Now if the call becomes in-the-money and the delta reaches 1.0, the MM needs
to hold 100 shares of the underlying, in the event the call holder exercises 
and the MM needs to hand over the 100 shares.

### implied volatility

Once news about a company goes public, the IV should go down- because the 
unknown becomes known.  When the IV goes down, option prices go down as well- 
because by definition, option prices are built on intrinsic and extrinsic 
information.  IV is part of the extrinsic. 

## extrinsic value

The more time to expiration, the more it's going to be worth- from its 
extrinsic value- made of implied volatility and time value.

## calendar call spread

Calendar call spread is a play on IV.  A closer to expiration option has lower
IV than a longer to expiration option.

Buying and selling of options with the same strike price but with different
expirations.  A basic calendar call spread would be 1) sell short DTE call 
and 2) buy long DTE call.  The short DTE would have negative vega and the long
DTE would have positive vega.  Overall, the vega is positive which means for 
every increase in IV, the overall option price would go up. 


### vega

Vega is the change in option price for each 1% move in implied vol.
This is a first derivative.  Vega is higher in ATM options and longer DTE.


### gamma

Gamma is the change in delta for each move in the underlying equity's price. 
In physics terms, it is acceleration, a second derivative. 



### gamma squeeze

Gamma squeeze is a self-reinforcing push up effect motivated by call option 
holders.  The call seller is required to buy up the underlying equity to 
delta neutral is short call positions.  This buying in effect pushes up the 
price of the underlying further- which increases the call's delta, further
requiring the call seller to buy more underlying.  For an equity with few
shares outstanding, this behavior induces further buying and higher underlying
equity prices. 

In effect, the underlying reason for a gamma squeeze are the market makers'
need to remain delta neutral.

### the fed

The role of central banks such as the Federal Reserve- is to maintain a stable
and growing economy through price stability and full employment.  The Fed has
two primary tools in its toolbox: 

* Setting short term interest rates.  The Fed controls the short end of the 
yield curve.
* Buying or selling treasury notes and bonds through open market operations.
    * Selling bonds to the public takes away cash from the public.  This 
    lowers the money supply- and reduces demand for goods.  This is a tool
    to use for lowering inflation.  During World War II, Uncle Sam sold bonds
    to the public not to finance the war, but to reduce demand for other goods
    and reduce inflation.
    * Buying bonds from the public puts money into the hands of the public.
    This stimulates the economy.  This is a tool to use during weak economic 
    times to flood the market with money.  "Quantitative easing" is this form
    of open market bond purchases.  Bidding up bonds also causes long term 
    interest rates to fall.
