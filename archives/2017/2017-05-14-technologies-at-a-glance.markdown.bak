With so many buzzwords coming up every year, it's very easy to lose 
track of what's what.  A technologist, like any professional, must keep 
reading to keep abreast of new developments.  

As homework for myself, I've created an easy-to-read guide below 
to organize each specific technology in its proper space. 

| Technology | C# | Java | Python | Javascript | Php |
