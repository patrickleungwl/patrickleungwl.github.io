While I'm enthusiastic with using Vim, I'm afraid that my many years of using
Visual Studio's Intellisense has spoiled me.  I now require the same method 
popups now on Vim when coding Python in Linux.  But how to do this?

First I backup my original .vimrc: 

~~~
" Automatic syntax highlighting
syntax on

" Stop vim from creating automatic backups
set noswapfile
set nobackup
set nowb

" Reload files modified outside of vim
set autoread

" Make tabs 4 spaces wide 
set tabstop=4
set shiftwidth=4

" Replace tabs with spaces
set expandtab

" If already indented, next line should be indented
set autoindent

" Show line numbers
set number

" Highlight col 81 to keep under 80 cols
set colorcolumn=80

" Set screen to 85x40
set lines=45
set columns=85

" Set editing to nowrap
set nowrap

set nocompatible
colorscheme oceandeep 
set guifont=Inconsolata\ 15
set guicursor=a:blinkon0

set foldmethod=indent
set foldlevel=99
filetype on
filetype indent plugin on

" Set split window navigation shortcuts 
map <c-j> <c-w>j
map <c-k> <c-w>k
map <c-l> <c-w>l
map <c-h> <c-w>h

set guioptions-=T "get rid of toolbar 
set guioptions-=m "get rid of men

source $VIMRUNTIME/mswin.vim
behave mswin

let g:miniBufExplMapWindowNavVim = 1
let g:miniBufExplMapWindowNavArrows = 1
let g:miniBufExplMapCTabSwitchBufs = 1
let g:miniBufExplModSelTarget = 1

~~~

Next I followed instructions for [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim).
Sadly I found the page instructions incomprehensible.  I next tried 
[this page](https://realpython.com/blog/python/vim-and-python-a-match-made-in-heaven/)
and similarly failed to install YouCompleteMe using Vundle. 
It's mostly there are some external dependencies that are blocked behind
China's Great Firewall.  I'll retry when I'm outside of the Great Firewall.
