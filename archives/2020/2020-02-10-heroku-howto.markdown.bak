#### Quick Notes

* File system - data written to the file system when the virtual server
  restarts.  Use a shared file storage system such as AWS S3 instead. 

* Sharing state across multiple servers- requires a distributed store like
  Memcached.

* Dependency management - requires language specific tools like 
  Bundler for Ruby or Ivy or Java

* Dyno- a dyno is a standard unit of virtual server capability.

* Logs- to see logs, do   heroku logs --tail 

#### Steps

~~~
heroku login
in folder container git repository
heroku create (this creates an application in heroku to contain the git code
it also sets the app to point to the git repo)
git push heroku master (deploys code to virtual machine)
