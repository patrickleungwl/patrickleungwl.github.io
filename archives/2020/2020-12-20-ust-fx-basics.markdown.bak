### UST Basics

* UST quote notation:  


### FX Basics

* Spot-currency trading is conducted through pips.  One pip is 1/100th of a penny. 
One pip is 0.0001 in the exchange rate of a currency pair. 

* A **standard** lot is 100,000 units of a currency pair.  One pip move of a standard contract
is 1e5 * 1e-4 = 1e1 = 10 units (for example $10).

* A **mini lot** is 10,000 units of a currency pair.  One pip move of a mini lot contract is
1e4 * 1e-4 = 1e0 = 1 unit (for example $1).

* The cost of a buy and sell round trip is the size of the bid-ask spread.
